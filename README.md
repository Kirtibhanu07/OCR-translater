# OCR-translater and Summarizer
- we have used EasyOCR to detect multiple languages and perform Character Recognition on the given image.
- using google-trans-new and googletrans, we have implemented direct translation from the given image to any of the selected language.
- currently our webapp is available to read English,Hindi,Kannada,Tamil and translate it to any other languages.
- Text Summarization is based on word frequency and sentence score.
- We will be using streamlit for front end development and streamlit cloud for deploying
- some changes were made in googletransnew.py file in line 151 ie removing (+ ']')
